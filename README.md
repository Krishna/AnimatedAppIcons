Demo project for [this post](https://bryce.co/animated-app-icons/) on [bryce.co](https://bryce.co/)

The bulk of the interesting code lives in `IconAnimator.swift`. This uses a couple private APIs, so is
not suitable for apps released on the App Store â€” but if you manage to build something with this regardless,
please let me know!
